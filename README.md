App created during the OmniStack Week 8, with the guys from rocketseat.

## Stack:
1. Backend NodeJS;
2. Frontend ReactJS;
3. Mobile ReactJS.

## What I learned: 
I already knew how to work with ReactJS, but with this course I was introduced to Node backend and the mobile programing with React Native.
